<h1>My Journal</h1>

<h2>Entry 1</h2>

<p>So far, I've really enjoyed Com Sci. As someone who historically, has never been interesting in coding, has found it really fun to work with css. I still feel super unfamiliar with the structure of the code, but I'm sure familiarity will have to come with time. That becomes really aparent as soon as one of my mistakes within the code comes down to something simple like a singular indent or period. I'm looking forward to being able the apply the basics I will the learn in the near future to make some cool projects.</p>

<h2>Entry 2</h2>

<p>After some time spent with coding, the process has been more difficult than I expected. The process of actually connecting the different codes you have written into one website has been no seemless effort of mine. It's honeslty been challenging to find my mistakes. I especially had some trouble linking href and button tags to link several pages with one another. Regarding my menu bar, sizing also gave me some trouble and I still feel as if I could improve spacing and centering. While maybe it does not feel like it in the moment, these roadblocks within my process have made the results all the more rewarding.</h4>
