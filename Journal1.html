<h1>My Journal</h1>

<h2>Entry 1</h2>

<p>So far, I've really enjoyed Com Sci. As someone who historically, has never been interesting in coding, has found it really fun to work with css. I still feel super unfamiliar with the structure of the code, but I'm sure familiarity will have to come with time. That becomes really aparent as soon as one of my mistakes within the code comes down to something simple like a singular indent or period. I'm looking forward to being able the apply the basics I will the learn in the near future to make some cool projects.</p>

<h2>Entry 2</h2>

<p>After some time spent with coding, the process has been more difficult than I expected. The process of actually connecting the different codes you have written into one website has been no seemless effort of mine. It's honeslty been challenging to find my mistakes. I especially had some trouble linking href and button tags to link several pages with one another. Regarding my menu bar, sizing also gave me some trouble and I still feel as if I could improve spacing and centering. While maybe it does not feel like it in the moment, these roadblocks within my process have made the results all the more rewarding.</h4>

<h3>Entry 3</h3>

<p>My current animation is an adjustment of the example code. However, after having a lab with Molly, she helped me understand how I can mess around with parts of the animation like position, animation, and duration. She also helped me understand that the initial div I create will be what I have to work with for my animation. I know there will be endless commands to play around for my animatio and I look forward to putting those into effect.

<h4>Final Entry</h4>


<p> The Final Project might have been my favorite assignment	from the year. However, this wasn’t necessarily due to the entailed coding challenges; more so, feelings of nostalgia. I loved looking back at my time; sharing it with others was more fulfilling than I had imagined. I don’t generally share lots of my personal life at all, and seeing the feedback and seemingly genuine interest from some of the class was pretty cool; especially from those who don’t even know me well. For the coding side of things, I liked using the reveal.js format for presenting, and I emulated the car project for something else within my project. I’m looking forward to the CS2 year, and hopefully, I’ll retain some skills.
