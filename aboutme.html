	<h1>About Me</h1>
 


<p>Hi! I’m a first-time coder and excited to be a part of the space for the first time. Outside of computer science, in my spare time, I love being outdoors. Whether in the water or on the grass, I’ll hardly say no to any activity, whether it be scuba diving, hiking, or skiing. I also love playing sports; specifically soccer and tennis. I want to learn more about diversifying my athletic hobbies by learning and trying indoor and outdoor rock climbing, boxing, and mixed martial arts. Within school, I love to write in English and learn about international history. While I consider myself more of numbers and objective thinker, I’ve been trying hard to focus more on my creative mind. I look forward to seeing how I may do so this year and moving forward!
