<h2>My entry</h2>

<p>So far, I've really enjoyed Com Sci. As someone who historically, has never been interesting in coding, has found it really fun to work with css. I still feel super unfamiliar with the structure of the code, but I'm sure familiarity will have to come with time. That becomes really apart as soon as one of my mistakes within the code comes down to something simple like a singular indent or period. I'm looking forward to being able the apply the basics I will the learn in the near future to make some cool projects.</p>
